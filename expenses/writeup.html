	<title>Differences between spreadsheet-like app and your newer app</title>
</head>
<body>
	<p>With my new app you will be able to:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Have a better understanding of how you structure your data.</li>
		<li>Quickly Analyse the data.</li>
		<li>More efficiently insert data.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Though there are some glitches present, given more time my app will be able to fully outperform spreadsheet app in managing expenses.</p>
